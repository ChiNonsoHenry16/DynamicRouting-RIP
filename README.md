# Dynamic Routing using RIP

Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols used in IP networks. It is a simple protocol that allows routers to exchange routing information and determine the best path to network destinations based on hop count—the number of routers a packet must pass through to reach its destination. The maximum hop count in RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks it can support (a hop count of 16 is considered unreachable).

RIP routers send their full routing table to neighboring routers every 30 seconds, which can lead to slower convergence and increased network traffic compared to more modern protocols like OSPF or EIGRP. To prevent routing loops, RIP uses techniques such as split horizon, route poisoning, and hold-down timers.

There are two main versions of RIP:

RIP v1: A classful protocol that doesn’t support subnet information or Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM).

RIP v2: An improvement that supports classless routing, authentication, and multicasting updates instead of broadcasting.

Due to its simplicity and ease of configuration, RIP is still used in small or simple networks but is generally considered outdated for larger, modern network environments where faster convergence and scalability are essential.
